        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Saturday Chicken Stock</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center;">This is not a quick recipe, 
        but the results are worth it. I usually take an entire Saturday
        to make this, but most of the time it's simmering on the stove,
        so it's not labor intensive. Chicken bones browned with celery, 
        onions and carrots make this broth dark and rich. I freeze leftover
        rotisserie chicken bones and make this about once a month or so.
        I freeze the stock inquart bags and use one whenever I would use
        chicken broth.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients you need</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>2 rotisserie chicken carcasses, broken into pieces</li>
            <li>4 carrots, cut into chunks</li>
            <li>2 large onions, cut into chunks</li>
            <li>3 stalks celery, cut into chunks</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon whole peppercorns</li>
            <li>5 whole cloves</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>1 sprig fresh thyme</li>
            <li>5 quarts water</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h1>
            <ol><strong>Step 1</strong></ol>
                <p>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</p>
            <ol><strong>Step 2</strong></ol>
                <p>Pour olive oil into the bottom of a large roasting pan;
                top with chicken carcass pieces, carrots, onions, and celery.</p>
            <ol><Strong>Step 3</Strong></ol>
                <p>Roast in the preheated oven, stirring occasionally, until bones
                and vegetables are browned, about 1 hour.</p>
            <ol><strong>Step 4</strong></ol>
                <p>Transfer roasted chicken bones and vegetables to an 8-quart
                stockpot. Pour wine into the roasting pan, scraping the bottom
                to release any browned bits of food; pour into stockpot. Add 
                peppercorns, cloves, bay leaves, and thyme to stockpot. 
                Cover the mixture with water and bring to a slow simmer. 
                Set heat to low and simmer, straining off fat as needed, 
                for at least 5 hours. Strain stock through a cheesecloth; 
                refrigerate or freeze stock.</p>
